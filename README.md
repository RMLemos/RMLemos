    I am passionate about creating easy-to-use, engaging, and practical web applications that leave a lasting impression.
With a master's degree in Entrepreneurship, my journey in the digital world began while writing on blogs and working on social media to promote the company I worked for. To enrich my understanding of Digital Marketing, I took courses, through which I recognized the important role of websites and e-commerce in the current business scenario.
Throughout my academic career and beacause of my appreciation of writing blogs, I discovered the world of technology, which led me to enjoy web development. So, for the past year, I have been dedicated to study programming languages and frameworks including Python, Django, C#, and ASP.NET in order to create robust, efficient, and engaging online experiences.
